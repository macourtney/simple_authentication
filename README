This project is a sample plugin for Conjure which provides a simple authentication scheme. You can create users, log in
and out, and set certain users as admin.

To install in your Conjure app, simply add [simple-authentication "1.0.0"] to your Leiningen project.clj file then
update the dependencies. Once all the files are in place, run the following command from your apps root directory:

  lein conjure plugin install simple-authentication

Simple authentication will generate some files and create a migration. The first thing you need to do is migrate your
database. You can do that with the following command:

  lein conjure migrate
  
If you need to remove simple authentication you can do so using the uninstall command:

  lein conjure plugin uninstall simple-authentication

However, you will need to migrate your database down to remove the users table before doing so, or your database will be
out of synch. Alternatively, you can remove the users table manually.
